-- Generate a report that evaluates the target performance for trips at the monthly and city level. 
-- For each city and month, compare the actual total trips with the target trips and categorise the performance as follows:
-- If actual trips are greater than target trips, mark it as "Above Target".
-- If actual trips are less than or equal to target trips, mark it as "Below Target".
